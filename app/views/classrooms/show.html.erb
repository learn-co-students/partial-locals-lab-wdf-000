Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom' , locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>
We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
  <%# <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.students.order("birthday").limit(1) } %1> %>
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>
