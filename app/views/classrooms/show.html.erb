Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>
We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<% @classroom.students.sort_by {|student| student.birthday}.each do |student| %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>
